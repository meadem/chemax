- in plots that have voltage on an axis, it would be nice to label the axis with the reference electrode, e.g., (r'$Ewe \: (V \ v. \ SCE)
    - be careful that the label matches the reality; best approach is probably to implement auto-RE correction during init
        - looks like I already did, but I don't like how noisy it is (it's like every trial) and I need to just double-check that it complies with the above
- Calculation of voltage decay for CP data
- Calculation of faradaic yield
- Calculation of utilization, etc.
- add ability to set color when using plot() submethod
    - may require some careful thinking
- Allow overlay of I-V curves and bode plots from different groups
- add more/better try/catch statements
- make diffusion coefficient print statement at the end of the cottrell method
  less noisy (especially bad when performed for many CA trials)
- Evaluate if/when a method for data reset is necessary, and/or a method for 
  undoing the most recent load operation, if deemed necessary.
- Modify tafel() method to print the tafel plot and maybe the corrected I-V 
  curve after it runs
