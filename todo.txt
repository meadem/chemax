# tafel method needs to accept multiple trials and default to analyzing all CV experiments

# I should try altering data so that it's just a df and not a df inside a dict

# in plots that have voltage on an axis, it would be nice to label the axis with the reference electrode (e.g., V v. SHE...)

# would be nice if tafel() method printed something out when it ran, like the tafel plot at least and maybe also the corrected I-V curve

# add method for resetting the data (and/or undoing the most recent load operation?..)

# NEED TO UPDATE THE BODE CODE BLOCK TO ALLOW PLOTTING OF MULTIPLE PLOTS (also add try/catch)
