# in plots that have voltage on an axis, it would be nice to label the axis with the reference electrode, e.g., (r'$Ewe \: (V \ v. \ SCE)
    # be careful that the label matches the reality; best approach is probably to implement auto-RE correction during init
        # looks like I already did, but I don't like how noisy it is (it's like every trial) and I need to just double-check that it complies with the above

# would be nice if tafel() method printed something out when it ran, like the tafel plot at least and maybe also the corrected I-V curve

# add method for resetting the data (and/or undoing the most recent load operation?..)

# NEED TO UPDATE THE BODE CODE BLOCK TO ALLOW PLOTTING OF MULTIPLE PLOTS (also add try/catch)

# diffusion coefficient print statement at the end of the cottrell method is a little noisy, especially when performed for many CA trials

'''
- Calculation of voltage decay for CP data
- Calculation of faradaic yield
- Calculation of utilization, etc.
- add ability to set color when using plot() submethod
    - may require some careful thinking
- Allow overlay of I-V curves from different groups
